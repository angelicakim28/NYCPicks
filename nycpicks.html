      <br/>Increased popularity of transportation network companies (TNC) in recent years has raised discussion on their competition against the taxicab industry. The spotlight on this issue has been particularly glaring in New York City, where the taxicab industry has been long-established.<br/><br/>Using NYC taxi trip data and Uber data from April - September 2014, this site explores and compares how these businesses perform in terms of passenger pick-ups. Here, the number of passenger pick-ups is a good indicator of passenger demand. A spatial visualisation of where and when these pick-ups occur is expected to reveal spatial-temporal similarities or differences in competitiveness and popularity.

      <h5><br/>Comparing Taxi and Uber Pick Up Counts and Hourly Averages</h5>
      <div class="text-box">
        <br/>On average, the demand for both taxi and uber rides increases as the day progresses. This demand peaks during the morning rush hour and evening rush hour periods.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the demand for taxi rides lags behind the demand for Uber rides - it peaks an hour behind Uber’s demand peak, and troughs roughly three to four hours after Uber’s demand trough.<br/><br/>Use the interactive interval selection to look more closely at how the total number and proportion of taxi and uber pick-ups vary at different time intervals of the day.
