    </br>PROJECT RATIONALE</br></br>Increased popularity of transportation network companies (TNC) in recent years has raised discussion on their competition against the taxicab industry. The spotlight on this issue has been particularly glaring in New York City, where the taxicab industry has been long-established. Using NYC taxi trip data and Uber data from 2014, this project explored and compared how these businesses perform in terms of passenger pick-ups. Here, the number of passenger pick-ups is a good indicator of passenger demand. A spatial visualisation of where and when these pick-ups occur is expected to reveal spatial-temporal similarities or differences in competitiveness and popularity.</br>There are three main questions that guided the analytical and visualisation process:</br>

      </br>1.<b>Overall growth: Taxi vs Uber: </b>In terms of daily pick-up counts, how did demand for taxi and Uber rides vary during the months of April to September 2014? How did these two demand trends compare to each other?
      </br>2.<b>Comparing Taxi and Uber average hourly pick-up counts: </b>In terms of average hourly pick-ups, how did demand for taxi and Uber rides vary throughout an average day during this period? How did these two demand trends compare to each other?
      </br>3.<b>Where do pick-ups most frequently occur?: </b>Where was demand for taxi and Uber rides generated across New York City at different hours of an average day during this period? How did these two spatial distributions of demand compare to each other?

    </br>A visualization of the total taxi and Uber trip counts for each day during the period of April 2014 to September 2014  revealed their respective demand trends during this period, as well as how demand for each ride-hailing service fluctuated by days of weeks. While the demand trend  for taxi rides remained mostly constant during this period, the demand for Uber rides increased steadily instead. The demand for Uber exceeded the demand for taxi rides in July 2014. Despite the difference in overall demand trends, both taxi and Uber’s weekly demand trends exhibit similar patterns - they both peak in the middle of the week, and dip during the weekends. This largely reflects expectations of traffic volume for different days of the week.

      <h5><br/>Comparing Average Hourly Pick Up Counts for Taxi and Uber</h5>
      <div class="text-box">
        <br/>On average, the demand for both taxi and uber rides increases as the day progresses. This demand peaks during the morning rush hour and evening rush hour periods.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the demand for taxi rides lags behind the demand for Uber rides - it peaks an hour behind Uber’s demand peak, and troughs roughly three to four hours after Uber’s demand trough.<br/><br/>Click and drag an interval on the line plot to look more closely at how the total number and proportion of taxi and uber pick-ups vary at different time intervals of the day.

    </br>On average, the demand for both taxi and Uber rides increases as the day progresses. This demand peaks during the morning rush hour and evening rush hour periods. What is interesting to note is that the demand for taxi rides lags behind the demand for Uber rides - it peaks an hour behind Uber’s demand peak, and troughs roughly three to four hours after Uber’s demand trough. This raises several points worth further consideration. Firstly, considering the fact that Uber implements peak pricing methods, and prices generally increases as demand rises, this may suggest that the demand for taxis increases when individuals switch over from Uber to Taxi as prices increase. If further studies prove this effect to be true, this brings into consideration the evolved role of taxis as price substitutes for Uber. Secondly, the observation that the demand for taxi rides is lower than Uber rides during peak hour, but higher during off-peak hours, suggest that it might be easier or more convenient to obtain an Uber ride during peak hours, when taxi cabs might not necessarily be circling around areas of peak demand.

        <br/>These GIF images show the taxi and Uber pickup locations respectively, at each hour of the day in New York City between April-September 2014. Each pickup point is represented by a point in the map and brighter areas are characteristics of greater pickup activity.

    </br>There are clear similarities and differences in the patterns of taxi and Uber pickup locations. For both modes of transportation, there is definitely less activity during the night-time hours (around 1am and 5am) with a surge in pickup activity during the morning and afternoon rush hours as also reflected by the hourly pick up chart above. Much of the activity occurs in lower Manhattan as opposed to the north of Upper East/West Sides and Harlem. The Midtown area seems to consistently be the most popular neighborhood for pickups, as portrayed to be the brightest region for every hour of the day. This is characteristic of the area, as Midtown is not only the largest central business district, but also an iconic location for tourist attractions and leisure activities.
    </br></br>As for the differences, taxi pickup locations follow a more structured pattern, where pickup points follow a grid-like arrangement and more clearly delineate the Avenues and the city’s blocks. On the other hand, Uber pick up locations are more widely dispersed throughout Manhattan, and a there can be seen a greater amount of activity occur in the Southern end of the island, in neighborhoods like Chelsea, East/West Village, SoHo, Lower East Side, and Chinatown among others. Another difference is that taxi pick up points are more centralized in the City relative to Uber pick up points. Uber pick up locations extend farther beyond the boundaries of the island, to regions like east of Brooklyn and Queens. These differences better reflect some of the advantages and characteristics that make Uber unique – people can benefit from this service in locations where taxicabs are less likely to be found.
